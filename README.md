MirandaRelayPlugin
==================

An old plugin I wrote for Miranda IM. The source was always shared on miranda-im.org but here it is under proper source control.


A computer with Miranda+Relay installed acts as a "middle-man" between you and all the networks you wish to connect to. 


The following are common scenarios where Relay can be useful:

1. You're at a work place where only one client is allowed/passes through the firewall.

2. You're using a mobile device and have access to a WAP/SMS/Java client of only one network.

3. You're on someone else's computer and that person doesn't have Miranda/your favorite networks' clients installed.
